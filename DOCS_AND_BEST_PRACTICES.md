## AppUnit: Documentation and Development Best Practices

### 1. Importance of Comprehensive Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is crucial for the success and longevity of AppUnit for several reasons:
*   **Onboarding New Developers:** Enables new team members to understand the architecture, codebase, and development processes quickly.
*   **User Adoption & Satisfaction:** Helps users learn how to use AppUnit effectively, reducing frustration and support requests.
*   **Maintainability & Scalability:** Makes it easier to maintain, debug, and extend the application over time.
*   **Knowledge Sharing & Retention:** Preserves critical project knowledge, reducing dependency on individual team members.
*   **Collaboration:** Facilitates better communication and collaboration among developers, QAs, and product owners.
*   **Consistency:** Ensures that development and operational processes are followed consistently.

### 2. Key Documentation Types

**Technical Documentation:**

*   **`README.md`:**
    *   Located at the root of the project repository and key module directories.
    *   Includes a project overview, purpose, features, prerequisites, step-by-step setup instructions for development environments, build commands, and basic usage examples.
    *   Links to other key documentation (architecture, API docs, contribution guidelines).
*   **Architecture Document:**
    *   A living document detailing the high-level system design, architectural patterns (e.g., modular monolith, future microservices), key components/modules and their interactions, technology stack choices, and major design decisions with justifications.
*   **Database Schema Documentation:**
    *   Detailed description of all database tables, columns (data types, constraints like NOT NULL, UNIQUE), primary keys, foreign keys, relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many with join tables), and important validation rules or triggers. Can be generated or supplemented by tools.
*   **API Documentation:**
    *   Clear, comprehensive documentation for all backend APIs. For REST APIs, this should be generated using OpenAPI/Swagger (FastAPI provides this automatically).
    *   Includes endpoint URLs, HTTP methods, request/response formats (JSON schemas), authentication methods (e.g., JWT, OAuth 2.0), rate limits, error codes, and usage examples for each endpoint.
*   **Code Comments:**
    *   Well-commented code, especially for complex logic, algorithms, public APIs of modules/classes, and any non-obvious assumptions or intent. Comments should explain *why* something is done, not just *what* it does if the code is self-explanatory.
*   **Deployment Guides:**
    *   Step-by-step instructions for deploying frontend and backend applications to various environments (development, staging, production). Includes configuration details, environment variables, and infrastructure requirements.
*   **Troubleshooting Guides:**
    *   A collection of common issues, error messages, and their resolutions for both developers and (potentially) advanced users or administrators.

**User Documentation:**

*   **User Manuals/Guides:**
    *   Comprehensive guides tailored to different user roles (e.g., Project Manager, Cost Engineer, Administrator) explaining how to use AppUnit's features and functionalities in detail.
*   **Tutorials & How-Tos:**
    *   Step-by-step instructions and walkthroughs for performing common tasks or achieving specific goals within AppUnit (e.g., "How to create your first APU", "How to generate a budget from a BIM model").
*   **FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions):**
    *   A curated list of common questions and answers from users, covering usage, troubleshooting, and general information.
*   **Release Notes:**
    *   Published with each new version of AppUnit. Summarizes new features, improvements, bug fixes, known issues, and any migration steps if applicable.

**Process Documentation:**

*   **Development Workflow:**
    *   Details on the Git branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow, GitHub Flow), code review process, pull request requirements, and CI/CD pipeline stages and triggers.
*   **Testing Strategy:**
    *   Overview of the different levels of testing (unit, integration, E2E, performance, security), tools used, minimum code coverage goals, and how testing is integrated into the development lifecycle.

### 3. Development Best Practices

**Version Control (Git):**

*   **Branching Strategy:** Adopt a consistent branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow for structured releases, or simpler GitHub Flow/GitLab Flow for continuous delivery). Main/master branch should always be stable/deployable.
*   **Commit Messages:** Write clear, concise, and meaningful commit messages following a convention (e.g., Conventional Commits).
*   **Pull Requests (PRs) / Merge Requests (MRs):** All changes should be submitted via PRs/MRs. Include a description of changes, link to relevant issues, and ensure CI checks pass.
*   **Code Reviews:** Mandatory code reviews by at least one other developer before merging.

**Code Quality & Consistency:**

*   **Style Guides:** Adhere to chosen style guides for each programming language (e.g., Prettier/ESLint rules for JavaScript/TypeScript).
*   **Linters & Formatters:** Automate code style checks and formatting using linters (e.g., ESLint) and formatters (e.g., Prettier) in pre-commit hooks and CI pipelines.
*   **Clean Code:** Write code that is readable, understandable, and maintainable. Use meaningful variable and function names. Keep functions/methods short and focused.
*   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid duplicating code by abstracting common logic into reusable functions or modules.
*   **SOLID Principles:** Apply SOLID principles for object-oriented design where applicable to create more maintainable and flexible systems.

**Testing:**

*   **TDD/BDD:** Consider Test-Driven Development or Behavior-Driven Development for writing tests before or alongside code, especially for critical business logic.
*   **Test Coverage:** Aim for high unit test coverage for business logic.
*   **Integration Tests:** Write comprehensive integration tests for API endpoints, interactions between modules, and database interactions.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Automate tests for critical user flows across the application.
*   **Automation:** All tests should be automated and run as part of the CI/CD pipeline on every commit/PR.

**Code Reviews:**

*   **Mandatory & Constructive:** Code reviews are mandatory. Reviewers should focus on correctness, performance, security, readability, maintainability, and adherence to coding standards and architectural principles. Feedback should be constructive.
*   **Checklists:** Consider using a code review checklist to ensure consistency.

**Security Best Practices:**

*   **OWASP Top 10:** Be aware of and mitigate common web application security risks.
*   **Secure Authentication & Authorization:** Implement robust mechanisms. Use strong password hashing.
*   **Input Validation:** Validate all user input on both client and server sides to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
*   **Parameterized Queries/ORMs:** Use ORMs (like SQLAlchemy) or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
*   **Dependency Security:** Regularly update third-party libraries and scan for known vulnerabilities.
*   **Secrets Management:** Use secure methods for managing secrets (API keys, database credentials) like environment variables or dedicated secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, cloud provider KMS). Never hardcode secrets in code.
*   **HTTPS:** Enforce HTTPS for all communication.

**Configuration Management:**

*   **Externalize Configuration:** Store configuration settings (database URLs, API keys, feature flags) outside the codebase (e.g., environment variables, configuration files, or a config server). This allows for different configurations per environment without code changes.

**Dependency Management:**

*   **Version Pinning:** Pin versions of dependencies (e.g., using `package-lock.json` for Node.js) to ensure reproducible builds.
*   **Regular Updates:** Periodically review and update dependencies to get security patches and new features. Use tools to identify vulnerable dependencies.

**Error Handling & Logging:**

*   **Robust Error Handling:** Implement graceful error handling. Provide meaningful error messages to users (without exposing sensitive information).
*   **Comprehensive Logging:** Implement structured logging for application events, errors, and key transactions. Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR). Logs are essential for debugging, monitoring, and auditing.

**Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**

*   **Automation:** Automate the build, testing, and deployment processes using CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
*   **Fast Feedback:** Ensure pipelines provide fast feedback to developers on build status and test results.

**Agile Practices:**

*   Adhere to the chosen agile methodology (e.g., Scrum, Kanban) and its ceremonies/practices as outlined in the development strategy.
